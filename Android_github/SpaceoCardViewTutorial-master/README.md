# SpaceoCardViewTutorial

Have you ever noticed a piece of content in a card shape with shadow?

Yes?

Do you want to learn how to implement it in your Android app as well?

Don’t worry, I’ve written a simple tutorial on [how to implement cardview] (https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/cardview-android-apps-example/) and customize it in your android app with one demo.

I learned implementing cardview while I was working on a project at Space-O Technologies - a [mobile app development company] (http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/mobile-app-development/) in india.
