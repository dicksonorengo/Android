# Contributing

As long as your pull request doesn't break the app in any way or conflict with an ongoing change (check the open issues first or send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) to make sure this doesn't happen), it will likely be accepted. I have a lot of projects and may not get around to reviewing pull requests right away. If you have contributed to this project before and would like to be added to this repository as a collaborator, feel free to send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) and ask.

## Branches

I am using the `develop` branch for all changes that will not immediately be available to users. Most PRs should be made to the `develop` branch. The only reason that a PR should be made to `master` is when there is a typo/inconsistency in the README or a similar issue is present.

This project uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/fennifith/Alarmio) to build and deploy anything pushed to the `master` branch.
